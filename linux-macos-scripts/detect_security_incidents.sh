# Script Name:       Ubuntu Automation Script
# Description:       This script simulates an automated incident response for a
#                    detected security incident. It logs the incident details,
#                    notifies the security team via email, captures system state
#                    information, and takes actions to contain and mitigate the incident.
# Author:            Christoph Hartleb
# Date:              April 13, 2024
# Version:           1.0
# 
# Usage:             ./detect_security_incidents.sh
# 
# Notes:             
#   - Make sure to customize the script according to your specific requirements.
#   - Some tasks may require root privileges. Ensure proper permissions.
#   - Test the script thoroughly in a safe environment before production use.
