.SYNOPSIS
    LogRotation.ps1 rotates log files periodically.

.DESCRIPTION
    LogRotation.ps1 is a PowerShell script that rotates log files periodically. It includes a function, Rotate-Logs, which performs the log rotation operation. The script does not include the actual rotation command, so users need to replace it with the appropriate rotation method based on their requirements. Upon completion, it displays a message indicating the success of the log rotation process. Any errors encountered during the rotation process are caught and displayed.

.PARAMETER None
    This script does not accept any parameters.

.EXAMPLE
    .\LogRotation.ps1
    This command executes the script to perform log rotation.
