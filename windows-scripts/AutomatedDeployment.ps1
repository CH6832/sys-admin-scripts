.SYNOPSIS
    AutomatedDeployment.ps1 facilitates the automated deployment of applications.

.DESCRIPTION
    This PowerShell script automates the deployment process for an application. It pulls the
    latest code from a Git repository, builds the application if necessary, and restarts the
    relevant service. Error handling is implemented to gracefully manage any deployment failures.

.EXAMPLE
    ./AutomatedDeployment.ps1
