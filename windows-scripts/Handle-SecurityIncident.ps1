.SYNOPSIS
    Handle-SecurityIncident.ps1 automates the initial response actions for a detected security incident.

.DESCRIPTION
    This PowerShell script is designed to handle a detected security incident by automating initial response
    actions. Upon detecting a security event, such as unauthorized access attempts, the script logs the
    incident, notifies the security team via email, and optionally captures system state information. Error
    handling is implemented to manage any issues that may arise during the incident response process.

.EXAMPLE
    ./Handle-SecurityIncident.ps1
