.SYNOPSIS
    EncryptFiles.ps1 encrypts files or directories using a specified encryption method.

.DESCRIPTION
   EncryptFiles.ps1 is a PowerShell script that provides functionality to encrypt files or directories using a
   specified encryption method. It includes a function, Encrypt-Files, which takes two parameters: $sourcePath
   (the path of the files or directories to be encrypted) and $destinationPath (the path where the encrypted
   files will be saved). The script does not include the actual encryption command, so users need to replace
   it with the appropriate encryption method based on their requirements. Upon completion, it displays a
   message indicating the success of the encryption process. Any errors encountered during the encryption
   process are caught and displayed.

.PARAMETER sourcePath
    Specifies the path of the files or directories to be encrypted.

.PARAMETER destinationPath
    Specifies the path where the encrypted files will be saved.

.EXAMPLE
    EncryptFiles.ps1 -sourcePath "C:\Data" -destinationPath "C:\EncryptedData"
    This command encrypts the files or directories located at "C:\Data" and saves the encrypted files to "C:\EncryptedData".
